(a) Your host has a directory with 10000 files stored within 1000 assorted directories.
Each file has the following format

Bob Johnson
+1 (310) 293 4332

Write a single-line bash command that will count the number of entries from the "310" area code.

After changing to the directory, we would run grep recursively and count the number
of lines (files) that is returned from that grep command.

$ grep ' (310) ' --files-with-matches --directories='recurse' . | wc -l

(b) Assume you have 50 virtual machine instances. What command would you run to collect the disk-free-space off of those 50 instances?

If the VM instances are running on the same host, and the VMs are mounted in a special
directory like "/VirtualMachine/", we can use a combination of df, grep, and awk
to output disk usage capacity and mounted location onto the terminal.

$ df -h | grep -E 'Filesystem|VirtualMachine' | awk '{ if($1 == "Filesystem") print $5 " " $9; else print $5 "\t " $9 }'
